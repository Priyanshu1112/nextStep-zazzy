        <br />
        We are thrilled to announce that zazzy has officially joined
        the Canadian AGS Group, marking an exciting new chapter in our journey
        as a marketing and creative agency. This strategic partnership brings
        together two organizations that share a profound commitment to design
        thinking, innovation, and creating meaningful experiences for our
        clients.
        <br />
        <br />
        At zazzy, we have always believed in the power of human-centered design
        and creative problem-solving. Our approach has consistently focused on
        understanding our clients&#039; deepest needs, challenging conventional
        thinking, and delivering solutions that truly resonate with their
        audiences. When we discovered that Canadian AGS Group operates from the
        same foundational principles of design thinking, we knew this was the
        beginning of a powerful collaboration.
        <br />
        <br />
        The synergy extends beyond methodology to culture. Both organizations
        believe in fostering environments where creativity thrives, where
        diverse perspectives drive innovation, and where every team member is
        empowered to contribute to groundbreaking solutions.
        <br />
        <br />
        As part of restructuring, we are now proudly based in Atlanta, a
        thriving metropolitan area that has become a cornerstone of innovation
        and creativity in the Southeast. This move positions us to better serve
        our existing clients while opening doors to new opportunities and
        collaborations across diverse markets. As we embark on this exciting new
        chapter, we want to be transparent about the changes ahead. Effective
        immediately, zazzy will be focusing exclusively on developing innovative
        products and solutions for the internal portfolio. This strategic shift
        allows us to channel our creative energy into groundbreaking projects
        that will benefit the entire network.
        <br />
        <br />
        Consequently, we are no longer accepting new external projects or
        reviewing hiring applications. Our talented team will be dedicating
        their expertise to creating exceptional work for our new family of
        companies, where we can make the most significant impact.
        <br />
        <br />
        To our valued clients, partners, and supporters who have been part of
        our journey: thank you for believing in zazzy&#039;s vision. While our
        focus is shifting, the creative spirit and commitment to excellence
        you&#039;ve come to expect from us will continue to flourish in this new
        environment.
        <br />
        <br />
        The future is bright, and we couldn&#039;t be more excited to write this
        next chapter. Here&#039;s to the power of design thinking, the strength
        of strategic partnerships, and the endless possibilities that lie ahead.
